# Obsidian Gmail Attachment Import Plugin

Downloads email attachments from Gmail based on partial subject matches. Currently I am using this to export iPad notebook exports for ebook highlights. But I can see it being used for a variety of attachments. But for now it replaces my main use case for Readwise, which does the same thing but through their own email service.

## Current State

Finds emails by partial subject and downloads the attachments.

## TODO

- [ ] Convert attachments to markdown
- [ ] Prevent duplicates
- [ ] Do something with the original gmails, like archive
- [ ] Find more subject matches for ebook use case on different platforms
- [ ] Use custom template to create note
- [ ] Make settings value an array of object with a folder and an array of partial subject matches
- [ ] Research and create a default labeled set of these arrays for certain common use cases (like mine)
- [ ] Do more than filtering by subjects (i.e sender, body regex, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for multiple email accounts
- [ ] Update documentation with setup instructions
